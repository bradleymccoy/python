Instructions for setting up Django virtual environments for apps on your computer 
	Use comands: 
	1. pip install virtualenv
	2. virtualenv myvirtualenv/random_wod  		(This setsup your new virtualenv)(where random_wod is present would be the name of the project/environment you want to create. Using random_wod because it is what I am creating for the first one)
	3. myvirtualenv\random_wod\Scripts\activate   (this puts you into the environment and shoupld cause the name of the project to be before the cmd prompt line) (ex. <random_wod> C:\Users\sc97960>) (to deactivate use same prompt but change for word deactivate instead of activate)
	
	in new environment install packages you will need for project 
	4. pip install django==1.9.5
	5. type pip freeze (this should cause cmd to return the version of django you just installed)
	6. mkdir myproject (mkdir is creating a folder in the user directory, myproject is what you named the folder you created)
	7. cd myproject/   (this opens the folder you just created)
	8. django-admin startproject random_wod (this is the syntax to start a new project. django-admin , startproject(instructions on what to do as admin), name of project you want to start)
	
	
	To Start a server from here 
	9. cd random_wod/   (go to project folder by calling cd project name)
	10. python manage.py runserver (you will get a msg telling you that it has started a server for you and it will give you the local host to type into a browser to check it. loacl host is always http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or localhost:8000  (fyi 8000 is the port number))
	
	To initalize Git and upload the application to heroku 
	11. get init (this should initalize an empty Git repository and give you the folder location of it)
